% Goal: Design a mechanism that fits in a 850mm x 1050mm footprint in one
%       configuration. The mechanism must convert an angular input into a
%       (nearly) pure translational output. The translation must be at
%       least 850mm along the x-axis, with less than 4mm of vertical
%       translation of the table's center of mass along the y-axis. In
%       addition, the table cannot tilt more than 1deg above or below the
%       horizontal.
